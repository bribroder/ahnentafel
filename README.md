# ahnentafel

> An ahnentafel (German for "ancestor table") is a genealogical numbering system for listing a person's direct ancestors in a fixed sequence of ascent. Apart from No. 1, who can be male or female, all even-numbered persons are male, and all odd-numbered persons are female. This construct displays a person's genealogy compactly, without the need for a diagram such as a family tree. In effect, an ahnentafel is a method for storing a binary tree in an array by listing the nodes (individuals) in generation order.&mdash;[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahnentafel)
